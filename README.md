In C programming language, a "stack" refers to a type of data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is an area of memory that is used for storing temporary data, such as local variables and function call information, during the execution of a program.

A stack typically has two main operations:

"Push": This operation adds an element to the top of the stack, increasing the stack's size.

"Pop": This operation removes the top element from the stack, decreasing the stack's size.

In addition to these basic operations, a stack may also have a "Peek" operation that allows you to view the value of the top element without actually removing it from the stack.

Stacks are commonly used in C programming for tasks such as managing function call frames, storing temporary data that needs to be accessed in a last-in, first-out order, and for implementing algorithms like expression evaluation, backtracking, and parsing. C provides an array-based implementation of a stack using a fixed-size array, or you can also implement a dynamic stack using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
